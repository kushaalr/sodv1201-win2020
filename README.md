# SODV1201 - Winter 2020

This `repo` (short for Repository) is for all the course content I create; use it as a resource for your learning. I have found this is easier to keep organized and you may feel that way too. All code I deliver, create or share in class will originate from here.

Additionally if you choose to learn more about Git and Github then you are also welcome to contribute to the code here via a Pull Request (PR). I've set up a directory with links to howto videos on Git and Github [here](/master-resources/github)
